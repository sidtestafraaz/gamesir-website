  # Fix token-based authentication for approval system

  1. Policy Updates
    - Remove policies that require authenticated users
    - Add policies that allow anonymous users (token-validated approvers) to read and update games
    - Maintain service role access
    - Preserve existing game submission policies

  2. Security
    - Token validation handled at application level
    - Anonymous users can read all games for approval interface
    - Anonymous users can update games for approval operations
